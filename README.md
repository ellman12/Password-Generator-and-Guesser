# Password-Generator-and-Guesser
Password Generator and Guesser (or PGG) is just a dumb little idea I had a while back. In short, the computer guesses a password, which is either automatically generated based on command line argument rules, or one that the user supplies. It records the number of guess attempts, and also has the ability to store guesses to avoid duplicating guesses.

This was made for two reasons: to give me some C++ experience, and to get some experience working with command line arguments.
